I intend to create a detailed and properly refernced version soon. You might even guess the function of a particular class just by the class' name and matching it to layers mentioned in the paper. I also plan to upload the dataset for the NMT task of translating from english to german soon that has preprocessing as close as possible to the original paper. Currently, this repo only contains the transformer architecture implemetation.
The implementation, along the transformer architecture, also contains three-way weight tying, proper handling of padding and illegal connections. These were the features I found missing in few of the online implementations. That's it for now.
